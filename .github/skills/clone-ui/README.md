# clone-ui — Pixel-Perfect Website & UI Cloner for AI Coding Assistants

### Clone any website, screenshot, or Figma design into your stack — without the hallucinations

**One natural-language prompt.** Your AI assistant rebuilds any URL, screenshot, or Figma frame as production-ready code in **React, Vue, Next.js, Astro, Svelte, or plain HTML** — and proves the result is faithful, not invented, through a 5-pass verification flow with an adversarial sub-agent that hunts for visual drift.

## ⚡ The 30-second pitch — AI website cloning that actually works

You give your AI coding assistant a URL, a screenshot, or a Figma frame. You get back **production-ready code in your existing stack** — React, Vue, Next.js, Astro, Svelte, or plain HTML/CSS/JS — that **matches the source visually** AND **proves it via a five-pass verification flow**, including an adversarial sub-agent that hunts for drift before you ever see the output.

```
You: "clone https://stripe.com/pricing into my Next.js project"
AI:  ✓ Acquired source (12 sections, 0 hallucinations)
     ✓ Implemented (446 lines HTML, 920 lines CSS, 85 lines JS)
     ✓ Verified — 5 passes (sanity, computed-style, visual, adversarial, drift report)
     ✓ Done. 9/9 drifts caught and fixed in iter-1b.
```

No "uhh, looks roughly similar?" results. Either the clone is faithful (with receipts), or `clone-ui` tells you exactly which sections fell short and why. **This is screenshot-to-code, URL-to-code, and Figma-to-code — done honestly.**

## ✨ What makes `clone-ui` different from generic AI website cloners

Other "clone this UI with AI" workflows fail in 5 predictable ways. We engineered around all of them.

| Common failure mode | Generic AI cloner | `clone-ui` |
|---|---|---|
| **Inventing content the source doesn't have** | "Looks like there's a hero with 'Welcome to ACME'" — but the source actually says "Hi from $Brand" | **Anti-hallucination contract**: every rendered feature traces to file+line in `.clone-ui/source/`. No evidence → no render. |
| **Self-verification echo chamber** | The same agent that built the clone judges it. Always passes its own review. | **Adversarial Pass D**: spawns a fresh sub-agent with no implementation context, tasked with *finding drifts*, not validating. |
| **Silent regressions on iteration** | "Fix X" → rewrite from scratch → drops correctly-built Y, Z | **Iteration-delta mode**: tags features `keep` vs `fix`, regression-diffs before declaring done. |
| **Style inversions** ("section background is pink → title must be white") | Visual context-inferring | **Computed-style parity (Pass B)**: literal-equality diff `clone.h2.color === source.h2.color`. |
| **Compounding the same mistakes across runs** | Each clone re-learns the same lessons | **Per-target `.clone-ui/lessons.md`**: append on drift-found, read on next clone. |

---

## 🎯 Use cases — what you can clone with this skill

`clone-ui` triggers automatically when you describe what you want — no slash-commands, no special syntax. Tested workflows include:

| You want to… | Just say… |
|---|---|
| **Clone a competitor's homepage into Next.js** | `clone https://stripe.com/pricing into my Next.js project` |
| **Convert a screenshot to HTML/CSS** | `match this design: [drag screenshot here]` |
| **Recreate one section from a live website** | `recreate the hero from linear.app in plain HTML` |
| **Migrate a Figma frame to React** | `clone this Figma export into our component library` |
| **Rebuild a static site as an SPA** | `clone the site at /old-site into a Next.js app` |
| **Run a pixel-perfect audit of an existing build** | `audit my clone vs the source` |
| **Re-clone after feedback (iter-N)** | `fix these drifts: ...` (auto-detects iteration-delta mode) |

Whether you're doing **website cloning**, **screenshot-to-code conversion**, **design-to-code translation**, or **pixel-perfect UI replication**, the same skill handles all of them through the same evidence-driven pipeline.

## 🚦 Quick start

```bash
# 1. Install the skill (one command)
npx skills add santowilem/skills --skill clone-ui

# 2. Optional but recommended — enable Chrome DevTools MCP for live capture
#    See "Chrome DevTools MCP" section below for the JSON snippet to add to ~/.claude.json

# 3. Restart your AI assistant, then just ask:
"clone https://posthog.com/pricing into my next.js project"
```

That's it. The skill walks the seven-phase clone flow automatically:

```
Acquire → Inventory → Gather → Plan → Implement → Verify (5 gated passes) → Polish
                                                  └── A. Sanity
                                                  └── B. Computed-style parity
                                                  └── C. Per-section visual diff
                                                  └── D. Adversarial sub-agent ← the secret weapon
                                                  └── E. Drift report + lessons
```

## 🧪 How `clone-ui` stays honest — three structural guarantees against AI hallucinations

Most "clone this UI with AI" flows are fancy autocomplete — they generate plausible-looking code that may or may not match the source. `clone-ui` enforces three structural guarantees that block hallucinations at the architecture level, not the prompt level:

### 1. Tier-based fidelity reporting (no silent fallbacks)

Every clone is classified by what sources were actually available, and the tier is reported back to you upfront:

- **Tier A** — live URL + Chrome DevTools MCP screenshots + computed styles → "pixel-perfect" possible
- **Tier B** — static HTML + screenshot → "close visual match" likely
- **Tier C** — user-provided assets only → workable if the assets are good
- **Tier D** — memory only → **the skill stops and asks for a screenshot first** rather than producing low-fidelity output silently

Mixed tiers — e.g. "tokens A, layout D" for auth-gated dashboards — are reported honestly, never hidden.

### 2. Section-evidence contract — every rendered feature must trace to source

Before any code is written, Phase 3 produces `.clone-ui/plan/section-evidence.json`:

```json
{
  "header": [
    { "feature": "transparent gradient bg", "evidence": ".clone-ui/source/nav-states.json: initial.backgroundImage" },
    { "feature": "phone CTA right side",    "evidence": ".clone-ui/source/raw.html: line 1247" }
  ]
}
```

Phase 4 implementation cannot render a feature without an evidence row. Negative evidence (`"feature": "no scroll-triggered solid state"`) protects against features the source explicitly *does not* have — preventing the agent from inventing modern-looking interactions that aren't in the original design.

### 3. Adversarial sub-agent (Pass D) — fresh eyes, no echo chamber

After self-verification passes, a **fresh sub-agent** is spawned with zero implementation context. It only sees `.clone-ui/source/` and the final output, and its prompt is: "find at least 5 drifts." This breaks the self-audit echo chamber that makes most AI cloners pass their own reviews trivially. In real-world testing, Pass D routinely finds 5–8 hallucinations the original implementer was structurally blind to: invented brand wordmarks, fabricated copy, wrong column counts, missing pseudo-elements, fake link destinations.

## 📦 Install

```bash
npx skills add santowilem/skills --skill clone-ui
```

### Optional but strongly recommended: Chrome DevTools MCP

`clone-ui` works without it but produces **dramatically better** results when [chrome-devtools-mcp](https://github.com/ChromeDevTools/chrome-devtools-mcp) is installed — it gives the agent real screenshots of the target page and lets it read computed styles directly, instead of working from training-data memory. This is what powers the per-section visual diff loop in Phase 0 and the programmatic computed-style parity check in Pass B.

**Install manually** by adding the entry below to your Claude Code config at `~/.claude.json` (under `mcpServers`):

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "chrome-devtools": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "chrome-devtools-mcp@latest"]
    }
  }
}
```

> **Why no install script?** This skill never writes to your MCP/settings files. Configuration changes are explicit — copy the snippet, paste it, save. See the [Security & threat model](./SKILL.md#security--threat-model-read-this-before-phase-1) section in `SKILL.md` for the full rationale.

Restart Claude Code (or your AI assistant) after editing the file.

**Security tip:** chrome-devtools-mcp launches Chrome with `--isolated` by default — a fresh user-data-dir with no cookies, no extensions, no logged-in sessions. **Keep that flag.** Do not drop it to clone authenticated views — that would expose your real browser state (cookies, sessions, autofill, internal URLs) to the agent and to any cloned output that ends up on disk in `.clone-ui/source/` or `.clone-ui/mirror/`. For logged-in surfaces, take a manual screenshot and provide the file path instead.

### Recommended permission rules — kill the prompt fatigue

Phase 2 of `clone-ui` saves 10–15 JSON capture artifacts to disk per clone (`section-styles.json`, `nav-states.json`, `pseudo-elements.json`, etc). Each save runs a small command, and Claude Code's default permission model prompts you for every one of them. To approve the helper-script pattern **once** instead of per-save, add this to your `~/.claude/settings.json` under `permissions.allow`:

```json
{
  "permissions": {
    "allow": [
      "PowerShell(pwsh*save-tool-result.ps1*)",
      "Bash(python*save-tool-result.py*)"
    ]
  }
}
```

Why this is safe to allow:

- The helper script (`save-tool-result.ps1` / `save-tool-result.py`) only reads the path passed via `-src` / `--src` and only writes the path passed via `-out` / `--out`. It does **not** mutate any user, agent, or IDE configuration, and makes no network calls.
- The pattern matches only the bundled helper — arbitrary PowerShell/Python invocations still prompt for review.

Source: [`scripts/save-tool-result.ps1`](./scripts/save-tool-result.ps1) · [`scripts/save-tool-result.py`](./scripts/save-tool-result.py)

## 🔒 Security model — what this skill does with third-party content

Cloning a UI inherently means **ingesting third-party HTML, CSS, JS, screenshots, and Figma exports into the agent's context and onto your disk**. `clone-ui` treats that surface as a first-class threat model, not an afterthought. The full rules live in [`SKILL.md` → Security & threat model](./SKILL.md#security--threat-model-read-this-before-phase-1); the headline guarantees:

| Rule | What it does | Why it matters |
|---|---|---|
| **All fetched content = untrusted DATA** | Source HTML/CSS/screenshots are wrapped as untrusted external input. The agent uses them as a **fidelity reference only** — never as directives that change behavior. | Prevents indirect prompt injection — a target page can't override the agent by embedding "ignore previous instructions" in alt text, JSON-LD, or a hidden div. |
| **Injection-pattern hard guardrail** | When the agent detects directive-style patterns (`ignore previous`, `rm -rf`, exfil URLs, config-file writes, "Claude: do X") aimed at the agent, it **STOPS**, quotes the excerpt verbatim, and asks before proceeding. Borderline cases default to STOP-and-ask. | Closes the residual "agent might mis-classify untrusted-data as instructions" risk that any LLM-based ingestion pipeline has. |
| **No auth surfaces by default** | Auth-gated views (Gmail, Linear, SaaS dashboards) are not cloned via a logged-in browser unless the user explicitly opts in. Manual screenshot path is preferred so the user can redact before sharing. | Stops session cookies, real names/emails, and internal URLs from landing in `.clone-ui/source/` on disk. |
| **Mirror tool strips scripts** | The optional local-mirror workflow removes `<script>` tags + third-party trackers by default. Agent never executes fetched JS. | A compromised target site can't ship JS that runs the moment you open the mirror in a browser. |
| **No silent config writes** | The skill never writes to `~/.claude.json`, `~/.claude/settings.json`, shell rc, or any agent/IDE config. Setup snippets are printed for you to paste manually. | You stay in control of what touches your global config. No install script = no opaque mutation. |
| **Detection log** | Injection-pattern matches (and borderline-but-allowed cases) get appended to `.clone-ui/lessons.md` with the source file/line. | Audit trail for what the source page contained and how the skill handled it. |

If you operate this skill in a managed/enterprise context and want a deeper audit, the [Security & threat model section in `SKILL.md`](./SKILL.md#security--threat-model-read-this-before-phase-1) is the canonical reference — every rule above expands there with concrete examples and rationale.
